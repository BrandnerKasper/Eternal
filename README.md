# Eternal

# How to Setup the Project correctly:
1. Clone the repository from the master branch <br>
  -> Use `git clone --recursive https://github.com/BrandnerKasper/Eternal`<br>
  -> We use `--recursive` to initalize and update the submodules needed
2. Open the `GenerateProject.bat` file in the project root directory <br>
  -> This should create the Micrsoft Visual Studio 2019 solution file <br>
  -> Open it and just run the Project!
3. Have fun :)
